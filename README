                            EoL Keyboard Remapper

A personal keyboard remapping tool that does the following in order:

    1. Swap Escape and CapsLock;

    2. If Escape is pressed along with H, J, K, or L, remap them to the
    according arrow keys; If Escape is pressed alone, the KEY_ESC event is sent
    only when Escape is unpressed; Ignore the holding events of Escape.

Note that when mentioning Escape in 2., due to 1., it's actually Capslock on the
physical keyboard.
